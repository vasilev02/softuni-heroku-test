My web application should use the following technologies, frameworks and development techniques:

• The application must be implemented using Spring Framework.

• The application must have at least 12 web pages (views/components).

• The application must have at least 5 independent entity models.

• The application must have at least 5 controllers.

• The application must have at least 5 services.

• The application must have at least 5 repositories.

• Use Thymeleaf template engine or make the Front-End using JavaScript, consuming REST services from a Web API.

• Use MySQL / Oracle / PostgreSQL / MariaDB as a database.

• Use Spring Data to access your database.

• Use Hibernate / EclipseLink or any other provider as a JPA implementation.

• Implement Responsive Web Page Design based on Bootstrap / Google Material Design.

• Use the standard Spring Security for managing users and roles.

• Your registered users should have at least these roles: user and administrator.

• User roles should be manageable from the application.

• Make sure the role management is secured and error-safe.

• Use AJAX to asynchronously load and display data somewhere in your application.

• Write Unit Tests for your logic, services, repository query methods, helpers, etc.

• You should have at least 60% coverage on your business logic.

• Implement Error Handling and Data Validation to avoid crashes when invalid data is entered (both client-side and server-side).

• When validation data, show appropriate messages to user.

• Use at least 2 Interceptors.

• Run asynchronous tasks for jobs that do not need to run sequential or for jobs in the background.

• Schedule jobs that impact the whole application running e.g. once/twice a day.

• Use ModelМapper or another mapping library.

• Implement one or more Advice (AOP).

• Use a file storage cloud API, e.g. Cloudinary, Dropbox, Google Drive or other for storing the files.
